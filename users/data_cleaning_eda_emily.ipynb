       "      <td>a general strike paralysed venezuela yesterday as protesters built barricades in the streets of the capital in an attempt to mobilise opposition to president maduro. the 48 hour shutdown was seen as the last chance to force the government to cancel plans to rewrite the country s constitution, a plot that mr maduro s opponents say will formalise dictatorial rule in the petrostate which is on the verge of bankruptcy. we are trying to defend the principle of the universal vote, that s all, said andr s ra l paris, 51, a lawyer who was standing by one of the hundreds of street barricades in eastern caracas. the opposition s calls to abstain from work was widely observed in all of venezuela s main cities. usually busy motorways were largely empty and shop fronts were boarded up.</td>\n",

       "      <td>the legitimacy of sunday s election to overhaul venezuela s constitution was under threat as many voters avoided the ballot box, nations across the region rejected the predetermined result and the streets erupted in the deadliest day of unrest in three months. president nicol s maduro had ordered a rewriting of the constitution. the election on sunday was simply to pick the members of the constituent assembly that will carry it out; there was no option to reject the process. hours later, a large explosion rocked at altamira square in a middle class neighborhood in the venezuelan capital, caracas, injuring at least seven police officers on patrol. video circulating on social media showed the uniformed officers, all on motorcycles, riding into a fireball that had just erupted in front of them. nearby residents applauded as the security forces threw tear gas at them. as the day wore on, government security forces used water cannons, rubber bullets and batons against protesters, just as they have for the last three months. at least 10 people were killed in clashes between the police and demonstrators, the government said, including two boys, ages 13 and 17, who were shot in the western state of t chira. a police officer was shot in front of a school in t chira, and a 43 year old man was killed in barquisimeto, the capital of lara state, when a bullet pierced his head, according to the state prosecutor s office. the results unfolded on a deadly day in which the maduro government showed zero tolerance toward pro democracy protests, with shock troops firing volleys of tear gas and storming squares in the capital and beyond. those citizens who did vote came under the watchful gaze of 326,000 national guards and police. security forces attacked opposition protesters in caracas on july 30th as president maduro pressed ahead with constitutional changes that his critics say will turn venezuela into a dictatorship. at least one improvised bomb was detonated near a police motorcycle convoy. the security forces responded with rounds of tear gas. several police officers and protesters were injured. note: the actual number of protesters was not provided in the source, and is based on prior coding decisions</td>\n",

       "      <td>members of president nicol s maduro s governing party marched triumphantly into venezuela s capitol building on friday, calling to order a 545 member body with plans to rewrite the constitution and consolidate their power over the nation. the constituent assembly, as the group is called, took a symbolic jab at their political rivals, parading through the gates of the legislative chamber holding portraits of former president hugo ch vez, which were taken down just last year after opposition parties won control of the national assembly. elsewhere in caracas, the capital, only a few hundred people appeared to be joining an opposition march to protest the new assembly. after four months of street protests against the authorities and the country s economic collapse, government opponents seemed angry and exhausted, struggling to find a path forward. they marched to protest against the constituent assembly and were met by government forces who beat them back. at least one lawmaker was injured, according to the opposition. but the number of protesters was far smaller than those who had turned out for previous marches.</td>\n",
